# Dog-breeding
A website for purebred dog breeding (Shih Tzu). Fully responsive, with a modern design and a clean, minimalist look. It includes navigation, a header section, a banner (currently disabled), sections about the breeding, the breed, the history of Shih Tzu, and a footer. There is also a separate contact page. The website is still under construction.
